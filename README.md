# Snake

Idea of this was to test out rust and ratatui works. This is one of the first project I have done with rust and used as a learning opportunity. 

AI was partly used to generate this code, but most of the code was coded by me and all the ai code changes was reviewd by me.

I used the https://ratatui.rs/tutorials/counter-app/ as the base of the code and updated it to work as a snake game.
